# Business Site

This is my project for week 3 of boot camp.

## The problem

I had problems getting my accordion to work which turned out to be in JS. It was my first project with JS. I also struggled to make my video header fit.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
